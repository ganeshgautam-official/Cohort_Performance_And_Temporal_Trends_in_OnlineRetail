# Cohort_Performance_And_Temporal_Trends_in_OnlineRetail
### Project Overview   
This project analyzes **cohort performance** and **temporal trends** in online retail to evaluate customer retention, churn rates, and revenue generation. Using transactional data from a UK-based online retailer, the analysis provides insights into customer behavior over time through the following:

- **Cohort Performance**: A detailed comparison of cohort-wise **retention rates**, **total revenue**, and **active customers**. This analysis identifies patterns in customer retention across different cohorts and evaluates how various customer groups contribute to overall revenue and active customer counts.

- **Temporal Trends**: Examination of key metrics such as **Total Revenue**, **Active Customers**, and **New Customer Acquisition** over each month. The analysis also tracks percentage changes in these metrics from the starting month, providing a clear picture of growth or decline over time.

The results are presented through an interactive [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ganesh.gautam7819/viz/CohortPerformanceTemporalTrendsinOnlineRetail/Cohort_Analysis_Online_Retail) that visualizes these trends, offering a comprehensive view of the retailerâ€™s performance in terms of customer retention, revenue growth, and active customer engagement.
