# Cohort_Performance_And_Temporal_Trends_in_OnlineRetail
### Project Overview   
This project analyzes **cohort performance** and **temporal trends** in online retail to evaluate customer retention, churn rates, and revenue generation. Using transactional data from a UK-based online retailer, the analysis provides insights into customer behavior over time through the following:

- **Cohort Performance**: A detailed comparison of cohort-wise retention rates, total revenue, and active customers. This analysis identifies patterns in customer retention across different cohorts and evaluates how various customer groups contribute to overall revenue and active customer counts.

- **Temporal Trends**: Examination of key metrics such as **Total Revenue**, **Active Customers**, and **New Customer Acquisition** over each month. The analysis also tracks percentage changes in these metrics from the starting month, providing a clear picture of growth or decline over time.

The results are presented through an interactive [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ganesh.gautam7819/viz/CohortPerformanceTemporalTrendsinOnlineRetail/Cohort_Analysis_Online_Retail) that visualizes these trends, offering a comprehensive view of the retailerâ€™s performance in terms of customer retention, revenue growth, and active customer engagement.
